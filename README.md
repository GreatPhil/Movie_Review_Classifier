# Movie_Review_Classifier
This project examines the creation and tuning of a Naive Bayes Classifier that trains on movie review (and other review) logs collected from _www.rateitall.com_.  The movies are now a few years old, but the same approach could be used on any similar movie data set -- regardless of the the movie vintage.
